1. It is better to point that id is null or empty separately.
2. No override equals method
3. toString method was too simple did not include lap records.
4. Had better return a collections.unmobifiableList() for lap times. 
5. Had better have synchronized method on getStopwatch in StopwatchFactor.
6. Had better use CopyOnWriteMap instead of synchronizedMap in StopwatchFactor.
